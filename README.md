# SaveEnvironmentApp
Android App for saving environment by saving money


## General Info
This Android App has been created as an attempt to tackle the problem of Climate Action which is 
a part of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The App is intended to be used by general 
people where they will be provided with ways in which they can save money while also indirectly 
saving the environment.

The user needs to create an account so that his/her progress can be tracked. We have used firebase
authentication for registration and sign in purposes. The user needs to enter his phone number and
he/she will receive an OTP which can be used for authentication and logging the user in. The app
presents different ways to save money such as by:
- Saving Electricity
- Saving Transportation costs
- Buying and Selling of used goods and much more

Users have an option to set a goal of amount of money they want to save in a month along with the
current amount of money they have saved so far. By engaging in different activities, they can increase
their saved amount and compare the results at the end of the month. We used Firestore database to store
the user information so that it can be retrieved from any device. 

Along with this, we have also allowed users to enter their ideas and post them in the forums so that
they can share it with the world. They are also provided with the option to enable notifications where
they can be notified at regular intervals about any unused running electrical appliances in their home.
